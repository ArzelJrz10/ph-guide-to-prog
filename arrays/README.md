# [Understanding Arrays | A Filipino's Guide to Programming](https://youtu.be/mx41USUjP3o)
## What's in this folder?
 - `python` contains **Python** code (the code you saw on the video!)
 - `cpp` contains **C++** code (the code you saw on the video!)
## How about the code?
Note that this code is meant to be a part of an "Arrays and Loops" video, so there are **no loops implemented** in these files, because I don't assume you know about loops yet.
### Python code
 - `no-lists.cpp` is solving the problem without any lists (seen in the video).
 - `lists.cpp` is solving the problem using lists.
### C++ code
 - `no-arrays.cpp` is solving the problem without any arrays.
 - `arrays.cpp` is solving the problem using arrays (seen in the video).
## Can I use this?
Yup. No worries on using it anywhere, even commercially. No need to credit me.
