## What's in this folder?
 - `cpp` contains **C++** code (the code you saw on the video!)
## How about the code?
 - `solve_practice.cpp` is a blank template for you to practice on solving the problem
 - `solve.cpp` is my solution as shown in the video
 - `solve_optimized` is the "optimized" `solve.cpp`
## Can I use this?
Yup. No worries on using it anywhere, even commercially. No need to credit me.
