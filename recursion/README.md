## What's in this folder?
 - `python` contains **Python** code (the code you saw on the video!)
 - `cpp` contains *bonus* **C++** implementations of the Python code in the video
## How about the code?
 - `iteration (.py/.cpp)` is the iterative (for-loop) implementation of the factorial problem
 - `recursion (.py/.cpp)` is the recursive (with for-loop for the test cases) implementation of the factorial problem
 - `recursion_pure (.py/.cpp)` is the recursive (no loops) implementation of the factorial problem
## Can I use this?
Yup. No worries on using it anywhere, even commercially. No need to credit me.
