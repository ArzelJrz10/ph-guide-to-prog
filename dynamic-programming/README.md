## What's in this folder?
 - `cpp` contains **C++** code (the code you saw on the video!)
## How about the code?
 - `naive.cpp` is the "natural," recursive solution we would make given our knowledge in recursion and backtracking
 - `dynamic.cpp` is the [memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) solution, explained in the video
## Can I use this?
Yup. No worries on using it anywhere, even commercially. No need to credit me.
